Sokoban game in Python originally created for use in AI Class at Colombia Univeristy in 2013.  Original repo for Sokoban game can be found here:

## Explanation

For the final project of 4511W.  We needed to use the information we learned in class to implement an AI.  We decided that we would attempt to solve Sokoban using a genetic algorithm.  Along with this code we (more importantly) created a report detailing every aspect of this project.

## Testing

You will need to uncomment the tests you'd like to run in test.py before running to have any output.  Each test you run will ask for a output file, some examples are already entered into the test.py as an example.  With our project we tested all the examples you can see in the test.py.  All data collected from these tests were then imported into Excel for Analysis which you can find in the Excel doc in this project directory.

* To run the script:
```
python test.py
```
